How git workflow works?
Git works on four fundamental elements 
1.Workspace-working directory
2.Index(stage)-project is added and ready to be commited
3.Local Repository-it resides in our systems and contains all the files with their commit history
4.Remote Repository-repository on the server to which every member will have access

What are the different stages of git project as commit,add?
=>different stages of git project are modified,staged and commit.
1.modified-we can make changes to copy of our project without hampering the orignal code
2.staged-the files which are added and ready to be commited but not yet commited 
3.commit-the staged files are commited to local repository

Is it possible to do a git commit before git add?if no,explain why?
=> No,It is not possible because as per git workflow first we have to add file from working directory to local index and then it can be commited. 

why is git diff is used?
=>git diff is used to track the changes made in the project.It compares the commited file with the file in staged area

Can we leave the commit messages as blank?
=>Yes,it can be done by using  git commit -a--allow-empty-messagw-m""


 ** Task 3
What is meant by the term fork and clone?
=>Fork:It means to make a copy of orignal repository in your account.We can modify the repository without harming the orignal one.
Clone:It means to copy the remote repository to a local repository.
Forking is done on github and cloning is done on git.

What are the branches of github?
=>branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of our changes.Each repository can have one or more branches.the default branch name is master branch.once we have made changes in the file we can merged it with the master branch.

What is PR?
=>PR:-it stands for Pull Request.PR are usually make to the owner of the forked repository so that he can  review the changes and then  approve.

Can we delete the master branch,if not then why?
=>yes,but before deleting we have to set another branch as a default branch.

How can we delete a branch?
=> by using command:- git branch -d branchname
